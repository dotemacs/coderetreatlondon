  WHAT IS IT?

  Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive TDD, clean code, pairing
  practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development
  and design.

  You pair up in your chosen language and spend the day doing a series
  of kata around Conways Game of Life that will sharpen your skills
  and get you writing code that smells oh so sweet.


  WHEN AND WHERE

  Date & time:
  Saturday 29th September 2012

  The day will be hosted by Camelot in our Covent Garden office with
  additional sponsorship from SkillsMatter.  We will break for lunch
  around 1pm at award winning restaurant Canteen courtesy of Camelot.

  WHAT TO EXPECT?

  An all-day long programming exercise, where you get the opportunity
  to practice your programming and collaborating skills. By providing
  developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away
  from the pressures of 'getting things done', the Coderetreat format
  has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill
  improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and
  object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to
  write code that minimizes the cost of change over time. You can
  attend as a pair or as an individual and pair up on the day.

  WHAT TO BRING?

  A laptop

  WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE?

  Anything you can find a pair for

  WHAT ABOUT FOOD?

  Camelot will take good care of us, providing refreshments and snacks
  throughout the day, and sponsoring a great lunch at award winning
  restaurant Canteen

  HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?

  Nothing, itâ€™s a free day.
